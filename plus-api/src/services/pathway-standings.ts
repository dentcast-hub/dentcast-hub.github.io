/**
 * WHO IS NEAR THE END OF A PATHWAY — the founder-facing half of the completion
 * certificate.
 *
 * The certificate plan is deliberately lazy: no exam is written until a real
 * person is close to earning one. That only works if something tells us they
 * are close, and until now nothing could. Pathway progress is DERIVED
 * (`pathways.ts` computeProgress) from the reader's own consumption, and the
 * `user_pathways` row is a CACHE that routes/pathways.ts writes back only when
 * the reader happens to open the pathway page. So a reader can go from step 2
 * to step 112 without a single row changing anywhere — the progress exists, but
 * only as a number nobody has computed yet. This module computes it.
 *
 * Four rules the rest of the file depends on.
 *
 * **The measure is `completed_steps`, never `current_step`.** `current_step` is
 * the "resume here" cursor and stops at the FIRST gap, so somebody who skipped
 * step 2 and read the other 114 has `current_step = 1`. As a reading cursor
 * that is right; as an answer to "how much is left" it is off by a hundred.
 * What decides whether an exam is needed is how many of the pathway's items are
 * still unread, anywhere in the list.
 *
 * **Bundles are excluded.** A bundle is 5-8 steps ("just the core"), and a
 * certificate for finishing six articles would spend the credibility of the one
 * that means something. Only full pathways (kind absent) stand here.
 *
 * **Progress can go BACKWARDS, and that is normal.** Publishing step 5.6 places
 * new content into existing pathways, so a reader who was at 0 remaining on
 * Tuesday is at 2 remaining on Wednesday through no act of their own. Hence the
 * alert markers are a HIGH-WATER MARK (the same shape achievement-sync.ts uses
 * for badges): once we have said "this person is near the end", a pathway that
 * grows under them never says it again.
 *
 * **The alert is one message per RUN, not one per person.** The first sweep
 * after this ships will find everybody who is ALREADY near the end — that is
 * precisely the news the founder does not currently have — and fifty separate
 * notifications is how that news gets muted instead of read.
